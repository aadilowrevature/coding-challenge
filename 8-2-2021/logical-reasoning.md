# Logical Reasoning

## This question is based on a certain code language. Understand the logic in the coding and answer the following question

If PROCESSOR is coded as D4F3C5C1E1S1S1E3C6, what is the code for QUADRANT?

## Solution

The Cipher is that two factors comprise the encoding. The first factor is represented as a letter, while the second is a number. Since there are 26 letters in english alphabet, the factor must not exceed 26 or be less than 1.

If a number is not prime it may have multiple factors, meaning it is possible to encode some letters in multiple ways.

1<=(A-Z)*(1-26)<=26

P=D4 => 4*4=16 <br>
R=F3 => 6*3=18 <br>
O=C5 => 3*5=15 <br>
C=C1 => 3*1=3 <br>
E=E1 => 5*1=5 <br>
S=S1 => 19*1=19 <br>
S=S1 => 19*1=19 <br>
O=E3 => 5*3=15 <br>
R=C6 => 3*6=18 

## Encode Quadrant

Q=17=Q1\
U=21=U1\
A=1=A1\
D=4=D1\
R=18=R1\
A=1=A1\
N=14=N1\
T=20=T1\
