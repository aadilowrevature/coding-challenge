# Logical Reasoning

A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday. It was noticed to be 7 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday. When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed.

a) 7 a.m. Saturday b) 7 a.m. on Friday

c) 10a.m. on Sunday d) 11 a.m. on Friday

## Answer

* 8 PM Thursday => 8:05 PM Thursday (5 minutes ahead)

* 8 AM Monday => 7:53 AM Monday (7 minutes behind)

* Total Elapsed Time = 84 hours
* Total Elapsed Watch Time= 83 hours 48 minutes => (83.8 hours)

* (0.2 Hours)/(84)=.002380952 hours => -(1/420)ddt? => -60/420 => -1/7 ddt (Minutes) per hour [decay rate]

## Question now becomes: In how much time does it take for "time ahead" to decay to actual time?

* Every 7 Hours, we lose a minute of time.
* To lose 5 minutes ahead we must do 7 Hours*5= 35 Hours.
* 35 hours from 8 PM Thursday is 7am Saturday

## Solution

a) 7 a.m. Saturday
